1|IT IS A MECHANICAL ENTITY.
1|IT IS RUNNING ON A SIMPLISTIC AI.

1|MANY OF ITS CORE SYSTEMS ARE DAMAGED.
1|OTHER SYSTEMS ARE NOT IN USE.
1|IT APPEARS TO BE CAUGHT IN A FUNCTIONAL LOOP.
0|Poor thing.
1|SUGGESTION: DESTROY IT.
0|What! Why?
1|IT IS UNABLE TO FULFIL ITS CORE FUNCTION.
0|You have a point. It probably feels useless.
1|IT LIKELY DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO FEEL.

0|But I can't do that without access to the ship.
0|I guess I have no choice but to destroy it.
0|I should be able to drill through it.
